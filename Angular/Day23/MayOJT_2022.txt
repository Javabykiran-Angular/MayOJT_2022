1 Template Driven Form
	- It is used for simple form 
	- all validation is done on view file except complex validation
	- It is easy to use 
	- login,signup,f/b form 
	
2 FormControl
	1 valid => true/false
	2 invalid => ture/false
	3 touched => true/false
	4 pristine => true 
	5 dirty => true/false 
	6 errors => it is object
				
	
3 steps
	1 we have to use ngModel => it creates a instance of FormControl(it holds a fromcontrol instance)
		u have use name html attribute
	2 create a template ref variable to assign ngModel
	3 to use errors object for validation purpose 
		u have to use required attribute
4 ngForm
5 json pipe
